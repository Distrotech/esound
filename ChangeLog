Sat Oct 17 02:20:42 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.c, acconfig.h, configure.in: emulated nanosleep with select
	for systems that don't have it. Compiles on DU4, FreeBSD

	* audio_oss.c: FreeBSD uses __FreeBSD__, not FREEBSD

1998-10-16  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* filter.c, mix.c, players.c: misc optimizations courtesy of Bibek.

	* audio_hpux.c: HP-UX patches courtest of Jimmy Olsen <jo@hrp.no>.
	It is claimed that esd now runs on HP-Ux

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, filter.c, players.c, proto.c: added support 
	for multiple simultaneous monitor streams.

Fri Oct 16 02:48:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.h: removed system includes so it doesn't "pollute"

	* audio.c, esd-server.h, esd.h, esdcat.c esdctl.c, esdfilt.c,
	esdloop.c, esdmon.c, esdplay.c, esdrec.c, esdsample.c: added
	in specifc #includes so it compiles again

1998-10-14  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* Makefile.am: esdctl now uses getopt_long, and therefore needs
	the LIBOBJS in it's LDADD.

	* esdctl.c: beefed up esdctl for industrial grade use.  added an
 	exit_usage function, and getopt style option parsing.  It was
 	destined to become esdsh, but this in combination with a real
 	scripting language should be suffient.

1998-10-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c, proto.c: trap for NULL name sent to sample_getid(),
 	and check for sample names beyond the head of the list.

Mon Oct 12 23:12:03 CDT 1998 Frank Belew <frb@umr.edu>

	* esd.h: removed anything resembling a socket header
	* esd-server.h: added everything removed from esd.h
	* audio_alsa.c: #include esd.h instead of esd-server.h since sockets 
	are not needed.
	* esdlib.c: removed superfluous headers that are already included from
	esd-server.h

1998-10-10  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, esd.h, esdlib.c, mix.c, proto.c, filter.c,
 	esdfilt.c Makefile.am, .cvsignore: filter patch courtesy of Bibek
 	Sahu. ten points to the first person to create esdequalizer. does
 	libgsl do digital filters?

Tue Oct  6 20:57:37 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.c: nanosleep in the no data ready case too, so we don't
	suck up CPU

Sat Oct  3 13:31:29 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* audio.c: added driver_trace variable for sound driver debug
	messages

	* audio_alsa.c: use driver_trace instead of esdbg_trace, since
	that's limited to the server. Fix Pav's completely broken fix.

Thu Oct  1 19:27:22 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.m4: make it work right

1998-10-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@piranha>

	* esound.spec[.in]: make autoconf do the version updating for us.

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: move version updating to same place.

1998-10-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ricdude@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_alsa.c: multiple audio card detection patches from Bibek.
  	This should open and use the first available card under ALSA.  It
 	has been tested on single card systems, and works fine.  However,
 	no one with multiple audio cards has tested this, so if anyone is
 	feeling brave and adventurous... =)

1998-10-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.h, esdlib.c: why sample size is treated as a long in esdlib,
 	but an int everywhere else is beyond me.  64 bit platforms should
 	be happier now. still have to check 32-64 bit interoperability

	* configure.in: touch-ups and commenting *shudder*.

Thu Oct  1 22:58:03 CEST 1998 Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>

	* esdlib.c: added kludge to esd_sample_cache() to make it
	work under Alpha. Problem was to send a long and receive an int.
	On Alpha this makes extra 4 bytes of crap enough to bring
	client and server out of sync. Probably a better solution is
	to change the prototype for size from long to int.

1998-10-01  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (esd-config): Turn on execute bit only if
	`esd-config' was generated.
	(getopt_long): New check.
	* getopt.h, getopt.c, getopt1.c: New files.
	* Makefile.am (esdplay_LDADD): Add LIBOBJS.
	
Wed Sep 30 21:08:19 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.m4
	* esd-config
	* configure.in: Added support for esd-config (like GTK+). Added
	explict disabling of local sound (for an audio data server). Fixed
	NEW_ALSA detection. Define HAVE_INET_ATON if we have it.

	* audio.c
	* audio_none.c: support for no local sound

	* esdlib.c: provide inet_aton implementation if it's not avaliable

1998-09-29  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.c: updated obsolete info. As noted by Sopwith,
 	termination procedure, clean_exit(), needed tweaking.

	* esd.h, esdlib.c, esdsample.c, proto.c: esd_sample_getid(),
	for fetching a sample id from the name, courtesy of Sopwith.

	* esdcat.c: FILE *source = source; /* hello, mcfly? anybody 
	in there? */ pointed out by Bibek, Sopwith, and others...

1998-09-27  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in: `AC_PROG_RANLIB' is rendered obsolete by `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL'

	* esdlib.c: added the missing esd_close() function.  no need for 
	clients to know they're dealing with a socket.

1998-09-25  Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* autogen.sh: added libtoolize --copy --force to autogen.sh per
	Andreas Jellinghaus <aj@dungeon.inka.de>

1998-09-26  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c: artistic changes 

	* configure.in: add check for nanosleep, Solaris needs -lposix4.
 	Also included potentially useful information for obtaining the
 	audiofile library.

	* esd.c: forced a wait in esd.c while in standby mode, so there's
	still some CPU to go around.

	* esound.spec: version number update, maybe make a esound.spec.in?

Wed Sep 23 13:05:11 CDT 1998  mej <mej@mw.3com.com>

	* clients.c, configure.in - Fixes needed to find FIONBIO macro,
	  at least on Solaris
	
1998-09-23  Kimball Thurston <kimball@sgrail.com>

	* clients.c - Make sure that the socket when connected is marked
	  as non-blocking

	* audio_irix.c - Fix to reset the output rate every time a sample
	  is played, so other utilities that play sounds and rudely
	  change the output rate on SGI systems can't mess with esd too
	  much

1998-09-22  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* AUTHORS, TODO: updates/formatting

	* acconfig.h, audio.c, audio_alsa.c, configure.in: "New" ALSA
 	driver detection courtesy of Bibek Sahu.

1998-09-20  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in: made esdplay a --enable-able option, that was fun.
	let's bump up the revision level here, too, while we're at it.

	* esd.c, mix.c, samples.c: i think i've got the 8bit stuff working,
	but it needs to be cleaned up, and preferably use function pointers 
	over if-else blocks to pick the appropriate 8bit/16bit algorithms.

1998-09-19  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* AUTHORS: decided to add my own name to the file, so people can
 	blame me a little more directly
	* Makefile.am: added optional building of esdplay.  
	* configure.in: added optional building of esdplay based on
 	whether or not -laudiofile is found.  made several "artistic"
 	changes to configure.in.  also added feedback about the expected
 	failure of the various audio header and lib tests.  hopefully
 	people won't think their system is horribly broken if not all of
 	the tests pass.
	* esdplay.c: added Simon Kagedal's auto format sniffing player for
 	esd, requires the audiofile library, which is in gnome cvs)

	* audio.c, esd.c, esd.h, esdcat.c, esdloop.c, esdmon.c, esdrec.c,
	esdsample.c, mix.c, players.c: allow different server rates, too.

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, mix.c, players.c: started the 8 bit server 
	overhaul.  many off by *2,/2 errors remain.  still straightening out 
	buf_size_samples vs. buf_size_octets issues... 16bit seems to work.

1998-09-05  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.c, mix.c, esd-server.h: fixed the annoying buzz while monitoring

1998-08-28  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_alsa.c: Nick Lopez - added the missing audio_alsa.c

1998-08-09  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_irix.c: Kimball Thurston - corrections for irix.

	* audio_hpux.c: Dave Glowacki - corrections for hpux and {esdcat,rec,mon}

	* Makefile.am, acconfig.h, audio.c, configure.in: Nick Lopez - added
	support for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture. It seems to work 
	just fine on my SB16 with ALSA driver 0.1.4 and lib 0.0.9.
	still needs audio_alsa.c.
	
	* AUTHORS: updated list of contributors

	* Makefile.am, acconfig.h, audio.c, configure.in, esd-server.h:
	Jeff Dubrule - updated for MkLinux (still need to merge in mix.c)

1998-08-08  Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* fixed Makefile.am to use libtool's versioning correctly :)

1998-08-07  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c: switched to memcpy instead of bcopy.
	* audio_solaris.c: added a few more recognized devices.
		thx to Tynian and Peter Asobeck for Solaris devices.
	* audio_oss.c: powerpc patches courtesy of mackman.
	* esdcat.c: forgot to check the FILE* returned from open, thx vendu.
	
1998-07-16  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, proto.c, samples.c:
	everything but recording works for irix. irix->linux connectivity
	and back works ok, except for remote recording.  keeping track
	of client states seems to be uglier than it needs to be. not so
	mental note to look into that. 

1998-07-15  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, proto.c, samples.c, test-script:
	almost got it all on irix.  still need to tweak sample caching 
	problems. other than that. tried to filter out the esdctl calls
	from test-script, as it doesn't work properly with an ESPEAKER set.

	* esd-server.h, players.c, proto.c: finally got the client state
	code to track endian status correctly, on linux and irix.  gross
	macros to track communication protocol level data. need to filter
	those out via cmd line macro at some point...

1998-07-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.h, players.c, proto.c:
	crack one at including communication level diagnostic info.

1998-07-11  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.c, mix.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c:
	tried to enforce some semblance of order on the trace/debug messages.
	added globals esdbg_trace, and esdbg_comms, for debug msg filtering.

1998-07-07  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c (esd_open_sound): *always* consider an "else" clause
	for every "if"...	

1998-07-05  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdsample.c, esdlib.c: added a confirmation step to the
	sample_cache mechanism.  esd_confirm_sample_cache(esd)
	should return the same sample id as the sample just cached.
	esdlib failed to read this indication back from the server.

	* esd-server.h, esdlib.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c:
	more endian swapping fixes. works for Linux, half of it
	works irix->linux, much seems to be broken on irix. added
	test-script for quick run through of features.

1998-07-04  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.h, esdlib.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c,
	woo! the endian swapping detection is in place, and works, at
	least for byte streams.  still need translation functions in
	the mix logic, to byte swap data buffers before addition.

1998-07-04  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, proto.c: following the lead of 
	the need_validation flag, it's possible that the same problem
	could occur while caching a sample, changed need_validation to
 	client->state, so it can track incomplete protocol requests.
	Still need to add the intelligence for the sample caching.

	* esdlib.c: esdlib now does proper arg checking (NULL for names)

	* esdcat.c: reverted to previous form, name is file (or nothing)

1998-07-03  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esdcat.c: pass a valid pointer for name in esd_play_stream_callback
	(quick fix; esdlib should really do proper arg checking)

1998-07-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_irix.c, configure.in: fixed audio_irix driver. works on an
	Octane.  Autoconf tools are a little weird on irix.  had to manually
	tweak the generated makefile to remove .deps references. added
	lib check routines to find -laudio. look into improving autoconf-irix

1998-06-28  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* clients.c (wait_for_clients_and_data): Return 0.
	(get_new_clients): Remove validation code.  Moved to
	`poll_client_requests' (in proto.c).	
	* proto.c: (esd_proto_lock): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_unlock): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_standby): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_resume): Likewise.
	(poll_client_requests): Centralize validation.  Move invocation of
	`esd_proto_{lock,unlock,standby,resume}' ...
	(do_validated_action): ... here.

	* esd-server.h (struct esd_client): New flag `need_validation'.

	* esdlib.c (esd_lock): Send `ESD_PROTO_LOCK' message, not
	`ESD_PROTO_UNLOCK'. 

1998-06-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* mix.c: removed core-dump causing optimization, thx to keebler.

1998-06-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* players.c: one-liner uninitialized data fix for the occasional
 	random sample killing itself.  Thanks to Chutt for the fix.

1998-06-10  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* samples.c, players.c, clients.c: fixed the perpetual looping
	sample problem.  incremented version to 0.2.2 for possible release.

1998-06-06  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* samples.c, players.c, clients.c: rigged up the sample freeing
	routines to check reference counts before deleting the samples.

1998-06-06  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.h, esd-server.h: moved some server stuff to esd-server.h.
	also added placeholders for an ADPCM mode, and endian issues.

	* samples.c: tuned the check for sample_id in stop_sample()

	* players.c: set up free_sample as the central player "destructor"

	* mix.c: added integral ratio of sample rates optimization.

1998-06-05  Myth  <frb@umr.edu>

	* esd.h: removed reference to config.h.

	* audio.c: added reference to config.h.

	* Makefile.in,aclocal.m4,config.h.in,configure,COPYING,INSTALL,
	config.guess,config.sub,install-sh,ltconfig,ltmain.sh,missing,
	mkinstalldirs: removed from cvs tree, since they are added by
	aclocal/auto*.

	* autogen.sh,HACKING: readme and script for generating files listed
	above.

1998-05-27  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Nearly working on Solaris.
	* audio_solaris.c (esd_audio_open): Clean up.  Make clear that
	this file only knows about CS4231 devices.

	* configure.in: Add checks for connect, gethostbyname and
	inet_aton. 

	* audio.c, audio_*.c: Arch dependent files define
	ARCH_esd_audio_foo if they contain the function `esd_audio_foo'.
	Otherwise, `audio.c' provides a generic function `esd_audio_foo'.
	(Tested only for solaris.) 

	* Makefile.am: Remove building of library without `libtool'.

1998-05-24  Yo 'Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd.c, esdlib.c: 
	added ability to free and reclaim /dev/dsp for use by other
	programs, without invalidating any sample references within
	the daemon.  sound output is consumed by daemon, and ignored
 	until the daemon is resumed.  created esd_lock() and esd_unlock() 
	functions, to hide the transfer of the auth. key from clients.

	* esdlock.c, esdunlock.c:
	removed from source. functionality superceded by esdctl, called
 	with options to	lock, unlock, standby, and resume the daemon.

1998-05-20  Isaac Richards <ijr@po.cwru.edu>

	* audio.c, audio_*.c, configure.in, Makefile.am, acconfig.h, esd.h:
	Added horribly broken(?) drivers for other OSs... These need fixed

	* esdlib.c: Need space for the \0 =)
	
1998-05-19  Yo 'Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esdsample.c: corrected a problem playing samples
	without a simultaneous stream which was instigated by the "better"
	blocking algorithm.  Added simple multiple trigger capability to
	esdsample.c program.


1998-05-16  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* esdlib.c (esd_send_auth): POSIX allows some systems not to
	define NAME_MAX.
