1999-06-30 Scott Heavner  <sdh@po.cwru.edu>

	* configure.in/acconfig.h: Change SUN_LEN test to use AC_TRY_LINK.
	Then change it more.  Are #ifdef's allowed in acconfig.h?  Seems
	like cheating, but it works here (autoconf v2.13).  The previous
	incarnation was using AC_DEFINE to setup a macro and wasn't
	working at all.

Mon Jun 28 18:34:10 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

    * acconfig.h, configure.in: Fix checkes against INADDR_LOOPBACK and SUN_LEN.
    
    * esd.h: Fix problem with mkdir() - if directory name containes "/" as a last
    symbol, it'll not be created...
    
    * esd.c,esdlib.c: Introduced usage of SUN_LEN instead of direct calculation.
    Move inline defenition of SUN_LEN to config.h.

1999-06-22  Richard Boulton <rjb37@cam.ac.uk>

	* esdlib.c: More self documenting code comments.  Nearly done this
	file now...

	* proto.c: Fix proto_data required size for esd_proto_stream_filter,
	so that we don't get annoying click whenever a filter is added.  (Was
	sending 112 junk bytes to the audio stream each time.)

1999-06-19  Richard Boulton <rjb37@cam.ac.uk>

	* esdlib.c, esd_config.c, esd.conf: Put time to wait for an
	autospawn into esd.conf file, and increased default to 100ms.
	(it was at 10ms, and about 1 time in 5 it wasn't waiting long
	enough for me.)

1999-06-19  Richard Boulton <rjb37@cam.ac.uk>

	* esdlib.c: Add some gnome-doc style self documenting code comments.

1999-06-17  Richard Boulton <rjb37@cam.ac.uk>

	* esdlib.c: Fix compiler warning.

Wed Jun 16 12:52:02 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* esd.h, esd.c, esdlib.c: All occurances of "/tmp/.esd/socket" string
	changed to macro ESD_UNIX_SOCKET_NAME - this is a bit cleaner, and
	allows to change name in one place only.

	* esd.c, esdlib.c: Fix a bug with domain sockets, when passing plain 
	strlen() of the socket name to bind() caused it's trancation to "socke" :(
	Changed to sizeof(struct sockaddr_un).
	
	* esdsample.c: Fix a coredump, when no parameters specified.

1999-06-14  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* esdlib.c: Fix bug #1276 - don't try to auto-spawn if $ESPEAKER is set.

Tue Jun  8 18:13:22 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* esdmgr.c esd_get_all_info(): Fix memory leaks: player_info and
	sample_info were not being freed after the do .. while loops.

Tue Jun  8 17:00:54 1999 Timur Bakeyev <mc@bat.ru>

	* audio_oss.c: #ifdef'ed SNDCTL_DSP_SETDUPLEX, as it doesn't exist in OSS
	3.0.9 under BSDI3...
	
	* configure.in, acconfig.h: Due to lack of INADDR_LOOPBACK in my OS (BSDI3)
	here is the check against it's presence in netinet/in.h, and if not, defining
	it ourselves.
	
Wed Apr 21 15:10:19 EDT 1999 The Rasterman <raster@rasterman.com>
	* esdlib.c, esd.h, proto.c: added "latency" request protocol to request
          number of smaples of latency you have with a stream to esd.
	  
1999-04-12  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* esdlib.c, esd_config.c, esd.conf, configure.in, Makefile.am:
	  Use a proper config file ($(sysconfdir)/esd.conf, ~/.esd.conf),
	  and fix auto-spawning of esd.

1999-04-11  James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

	* esound.spec.in: moved %{prefix}/lib/lib*.so files to the main
	esound package from the devel one, as esddsp requires them to
	function correctly.

Thu Apr  8 23:08:56 PDT 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* acinclude.m4
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: libtool 1.2f

	* esd.c: use INADDR constants instead of inet_addr calls (was
	broken before)

	* esddsp.c: minor tweaks

1999-03-30  The Rasterman <raster@rasterman.com>
        * esdlib.c, esd.c: added UNIX domain sockets as the "default" 
	  (less overhead than tcp/ip for a local machine - better for
	  less soudn breakup) - as well as =ctp option for tcp/ip mode.
	  Also made esd auto fallback to 8bit, mono and lower sampling
	  rates if the device cannot handle it.
	  
1999-03-09  The Rasterman <raster@rasterman.com>
	* esdlib.c, esd.c: added SIGPIPE handlers and wrappign in all 
	  libesd calls so "death" of esd and connection is trapped
	  properly. Also added to auth protocol a "reply" for auth so
	  authorisation is known at socket open time. same for esd.
	  Tested and works. 

1999-02-20  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* README, TIPS, TODO: updates
	* configure.in: call it 0.2.8. [and there was much rejoicing...]

1999-02-16  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>


	* esd-server.h, esd.c, proto.c: added forced standby tracker for
	greater accuracy in tracking forced standby vs. autostandby modes
	* clients.c: autostandby/standby cpu buglet
	* esd.h, proto.c, esdmgr.c: added ability to get server mode,
	e.g. standby, autostandby, running, etc.
	* many other modules: -Wall clean up

	* players.c, proto.c, samples.c: gracefully handle error
 	conditions from ESD_READ_*, i.e. check return values.

Mon Feb 15 18:19:31 EST 1999 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* esdlib.c: boy am I getting tired of reading the
	"cannot connect to esound server" error message whenever I don't
	have esd running from that file.  there needs to be a better
	way to dump out this error.  maybe some sort of rotatable message
	file?  who knows?  but not like that.

1999-02-14  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd.c: less brutal audio flushing algorithm.

1999-02-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>
	
	* esdfile.c, esdlib.c: added and commented out diagnostic code. 
	* esd-server.h, esd.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c, players.c:
 	add flag to force sample deletion, and force sample deletion only
 	when we shut down the server
	* samples.c, players.c: check for addition of NULL
 	samples/players.
	* players.c: helps if you put the recorder stream's, writeable
	fd_set mask in the proper place within the select call - thx. Chutt

1999-02-10  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd.c, esdlib.c: only check for more data if the
	stream isn't a monitor stream, as there's nothing to read anyway.
	correct condition on esd_autostandby_secs for pausing. use the
	host representation of the port number instead of network order.

Fri Feb  5 14:28:17 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd-config.in: erk. NEVER include @CFLAGS@ or @LDFLAGS@ in these
	scripts. They should not be propagated to client packages

1999-02-03  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.c: yet another CPU usage fix, courtesy of Chutt

1999-02-01  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@redhat.com>

	* Revert session management changes until further discussion.

Mon Feb  1 01:24:43 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esddsp.c: stupid interim hack for SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE so x11amp 0.9a
	works properly

	* esddsp.in: -m flag to enable mixer support

1999-01-31  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* LICENSE, COPYING.LIB: Make some effort at license term disclosure.

1999-01-30  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* proto.c: corrected stream play/record/monitor protocol data lengths

1999-01-28  Felix Bellaby <felix@pooh.u-net.com>

	* session.c: implements session management protocol to avoid race
	conditions under gnome and allow for respawning.
	* Makefile.am, esd-config, config.in: add in SM checks.
	* esd.c (main): add SM argument passing, setup and ICE polling.
	* clients.c (wait_clients_and_data): add ICE to blocking select.
	
1999-01-26  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c: fixed recently broken autosuspend feature

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, players.c: move recorder_write guts to a
	separate function, to be used by monitors, and filters.

Mon Jan 25 03:16:30 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esddsp.c: added a /dev/mixer wrapper. Set ESDDSP_MIXER=1 to
	for all /dev/mixer access to be trapped. It will save and load
	the mixer settings in ~/.esddsp.{name}.

1999-01-25  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* mix.c, proto.c: volume control wired into the mix functions.

1999-01-24  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* filter.c, players.c: fix filters to work with the translation
 	function pointers.

	* esdfilt.c: add some processing (double or halve the audio
 	signal) so we can tell if the filter is doing anything useful.

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esdlib.c, players.c, stamp-h.in:
 	factored into a function the setsockopt calls for setting the
 	socket options for the socket buffer sizes in the court of king
 	caracticus, which was just passing by...

1999-01-24  bertrand <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@inria.fr>

	* configure.in (audiofile check): Fixed a small typo

1999-01-23  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* Makefile.am, esound.spec.in: updated web site, and added an rpm
	target to the makefile. "make rpm" and it should go do it's thing.

1999-01-14  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* players.c: fix the recorder_write and monitor_write function to
 	use translate function.
 	
	* clients.c: fixes to the pause vs. sleep issue. select()s forever
 	if nothing to do, i.e. not recording and no samples playing.
  	
	* esd-server.h, mix.c, esd.c, filter.c, proto.c: translate
 	function pointers sketched out.  added a mixer engine debug
 	switch. filters, recorders and monitors are most likely horribly
 	broken for now.
 	
	* README, TODO: cleanups, updates, typos

Thu Jan 14 22:52:02 PST 1999 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.c: corrected -d help text

	* esdctl.c: 0 is a perfectly valid argument for volumes, so don't
	filter it out

	* esddsp.in: libdl isn't everywhere, don't specify it (libtool
	deps will take care of that)

	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in: check for libdl

	* acinclude.m4
	* ltconfig
	* ltmain.sh: libtool 1.2d for linux shared library deps

1999-01-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, mix.c, players.c, samples.c: first take at
 	using function pointers for the mix functions.  probably breaks
 	filters, and who knows what else.  NOTE: work in progress, beware!

1999-01-10  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esddsp.in: corrected format of LD_PRELOAD entries, and added
	LD_PRELOAD_PATH to make things a bit cleaner.  Should correct the
	"error loading shared libs: symbol dlsym not found" problems

1998-12-30  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdmgr.c, proto.c: workaround for zero additional data protocol
	handlers.  just require an int of data for now. fix noted in source. 

	* audio.c, audio_alsa.c, audio_oss.c, audio_solaris.c, esd.c,
 	esd.h: added -d DEVICE option - use an alternate audio device.
  	This sets esd_audio_device (const char *) which can be used by the
 	platform specific esd_audio_open() functions.  audio_oss updated,
 	audio_solaris updated but not tested.  other updates requested.

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, samples.c: actually reset *everything* in
	the daemon on a SIGHUP

1998-12-29  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.c, proto.c, samples.c: option to
	autosuspend after a number of seconds of audio inactivity.
	"esd -as SECS" to set timeout to SECS seconds, SECS > 0.
	* esd.c, clients.c: call esd_audio_pause() only if select has
 	returned no clients ready, and no samples are playing.  other
	miscellaneous tweaks to the when-to-sleep algorithm...
	* players.c: add a variable so we know if we're playing samples
	* all other server files: editorial changes, prettier for printing 
	
1998-12-27  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* proto.c: missed one code path for setting is_ok...
	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.c, esd.h, esdloop.c, esdsample.c, 
	filter.c, mix.c, players.c, proto.c: moved some prototypes to
	more logical locations, and general -ansi -Wall -pedantic stuff.
	* esd.c: added -h option for usage.

1998-12-22  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_alsa.c, clients.c: from bibek, more alsa patches and a
 	slightly more sane "can i pause" algorithm.

Mon Dec 21 21:44:44 EST 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* esdlib.c - fixed some warnings.

1998-12-21  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.h, players.c, proto.c, samples.c:
 	Cleaned out the protocol handling.  Basically, there's now a table
 	of protocol handlers and how much data they each require.  Each
 	client has a buffer to hold the extra data for the current
 	protocol handler.  poll_client_requests() reads data one chunk at
 	a time, until it gets everything it needs for that request.  The
 	handler then gets its data directly from the buffer, instead of
 	messing around with all this state transition stuff.
	* configure.in: setting bin_SCRIPTS to include esd-config should
 	set the execute flag on the script when installed.
	* esdlib.c: this needs esd.h, not esd-server.h.
	* mix.c, esd-server.h: debugging info update.

Sat Dec 19 21:19:51 EST 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* down to just 7 warnings compiling on my system now -- everything
	works pretty well now, I think, too.  still a few 8bit sound problems
	with samples, which I may look into later this weekend.

Sat Dec 19 14:02:41 EST 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* cleaned up warnings and a little bit of code here and there.
	(when you've got as many compiler warning flags turned on as I do
	this code was starting to look a bit horrendous compiling)  I'm
	not 100% done, but this is a good start.

Thu Dec 10 20:55:43 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.c: use nanosleep if we have it, it seems to work better
	(at least for me)

Tue Dec  8 23:32:52 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in
	* esd-config.in: correctly handle AUDIOFILE_* vars

	* Makefile.am
	* configure.in
	* esddsp.c: use dlsym instead of __func. Now works with glibc 2.1
	and FreeBSD (maybe others? testers wanted)

1998-12-08  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, esd-server.h: use autoconf to turn
 	on/off insanely verbose diagnostic information

	* clients.c: improved timeout for select algorithm - if we're
 	recording, return immediately, otherwise timeout after 1/2 an
 	ESD_BUF_SIZE amount of time.

	* esd.c: just use select instead of this nanosleep stuff.

	* samples.c, players.c: fixed problems with looping samples and a
 	pointer assignment warning

Wed Dec  2 11:27:20 EST 1998 The Rasterman  <raster@rasterman.com>

	* clients.c, esd.c, esdlib.c, players.c: Added setsockopt to set the
	socket bufferign options to the minimum needed to keep esd fed with
	audio data to also minimize "lag" with streams. Seems to work fine.

1998-11-30  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* configure.in:
	Don't dump environment to stdout.  Every user doesn't need to
	see this data, just a few hackers.

1998-11-28  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* players.c, samples.c: swap 16 bit audio data if the server and
	client are on differring endian machines. - not tested! =)
	
	* configure.in: --enable-esdplay has been converted to
 	--with-libaudiofile. some files of the esound source WILL NOT
 	currently compile unless libaudiofile is installed.  with the
 	inclusion of the audio file handling routines, libaudiofile is now
 	a requirement for esound.  Anyone wishing to patch the source so
 	it will still compile without libaudiofile is welcome to.

	* esd.h, esdfile.c, esdplay.c, esdsample.c: add a string to
	differentiate between sample files cached by different programs with
	the same name.

	* Makefile.am, esdfile.c, esd.h: added convenient audiofile
	wrappers for playing and caching audio file data. 
	* esd.h, esdlib.c: const clean up.
	* esdmgr.c: added name to print info functions.
	* esdplay.c, esdsample.c: updated to use audiofile wrappers.
	NOTE: this means that the AUDIOFILE library is now REQUIRED for
	proper compilation of esound.  configure.in will be updated soon.
	
Mon Nov 23 06:34:43 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: allow manual enable/disabling of alsa support

1998-10-21 Bertrand Guiheneuf <Bertrand.Guiheneuf@inria.fr>

        * use the audiofile.m4 macro to detect libaudiofile

1998-11-09  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esdlib.c, filter.c, mix.c, players.c, proto.c
	samples.c: use the freshly updated debugging macros

	* esd-server.h, esd.h, esdctl.c, esdlib.c, esdmgr.c, mix.c,
	players.c, proto.c, samples.c: initial support for setting stereo
	panning of streams and samples, just need to update mix.c to do
	the scaling...

Sat Nov  7 05:28:03 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esddsp.c: Hmmph. The ES1370 driver blocks on open unless
	O_NONBLOCK is set explictly. So now we strcmp always, and
	set O_NONBLOCK on fallback only for the sound device.

	* esdlib.c: removed fsync's here too

1998-11-06  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* samples.c, players.c, proto.c: fixed rounding to multiple of 4
	algorithm, and removed fsync's as they don't do anything for a
	socket.  patches suggested by Miodrag Vallat.

1998-11-05  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_aix.c: typo fixes courtest of Philippe Defert

1998-11-04  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* TODO, esd.h, esdctl.c, esdmgr.c, proto.c: It really should have
 	been esd_free_all_info(), and while we're at it, make it do
 	something potentially useful.
  	
	* esound.spec: set it up for autoconf to update the version
 	number, then lost the changes. thanks to Michael Sterrett.

1998-11-03  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* esdctl.c (main): Change call from esd_free_all_info() to
 	esd_free_esd_info() so that this will build.

1998-11-03  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* TODO, configure.in: update version number
	* Makefile.am, esd-server.h, esd.h, esdctl.c, proto.c, esdmgr.c: 
	add initial framework for remote management of server, filter out
	diagnostic/debugging information from binary if we don't want it.
	also inlcude esound.spec file in distribution.

Sat Oct 31 21:36:07 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esddsp.c: don't try to open local sound device if ESPEAKER is set

1998-10-31  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* EsounD.html, EsounD.ps, Makefile.am: replaced EsounD.html with
 	EsounD.ps until the doc subdirectory is functional with docbook.
	* configure.in: call it 0.2.6.

Fri Oct 30 20:39:16 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esddsp.c: provide implementation for close() to expire sndfd

1998-10-28  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esound.spec.in: reordered the changelog entries, as rpm likes to 
	complain about it if the order is backwards...

1998-10-24  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_alsa.c: reworked alsa card detection per patch from 
	Andrew Clausen <clausen@alphalink.com.au>

Wed Oct 21 23:57:11 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* esdplay.c (play_file): The computation of bytes_per_frame was
	not taking the number of channels into account. It does now.

1998-10-21  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esddsp.c, esddsp.in: give esddsp some class, allow for passing
	of identifying name to esd via environment variable

Tue Oct 20 20:43:48 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* clients.c: make optional use of tcp_wrappers

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: OSS runs on other platforms too, so
 	explictly special case for linux for esddsp. Also don't install
 	the wrapper script if esddsp isn't supported. Add a check for
 	libwrap and friends. Some reorganization.

	* esddsp.c: respond to SNDCTL_DSP_GETCAPS (and say we can't do much)
	More evilness to get multiple x11amps to coexist (optional)

	* esddsp.in: exec instead of just run

1998-10-19  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* Makefile.am, esddsp.in, configure.in: automatically build the
	esddsp wrapper script for Linux only

Sun Oct 18 21:33:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* Makefile.am: add TODO and esddsp.c to EXTRA_DIST

	* esddsp.c: somewhat of a rewrite. We only try to use esound
	if an open() fails. This lets the no esound case fall back to
	/dev/dsp, and also doesn't do a strcmp on every call to open.
	Got rid of the varargs junk in ioctl, I've never seen an ioctl
	with more than one extra arg anyway (please tell me if I'm wrong).
	Reworked the code, so we're not so x11amp specific, i.e. the
	esound socket is opened immediately after all the info is set.
	We also make sure we don't try to set it again. Default to mono
	output per OSS specs. open/close/open with multiple formats
	works. Provide a default value for GETFMTS. The result of all
	this is that libesddsp works with a lot more stuff now. I've
	tested x11amp, mpg123, amp, freeamp, xanim, rvplayer, and
	esound itself. ;) (a side effect is that rvplayer works on
	Linux 2.1.120+ kernels as well)

1998-10-18  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esddsp.c, proto.c: fixed inconsistency in esd_on_standby
 	handling withing esd_proto_resume and esd_proto_standby. 

	* esd.c: removed unused variable, audio

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, esddsp.c, players.c: how did monitoring
	ever work like that? corrected the header, actually passed in the
	length of the monitor buffer.

1998-10-17  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (nanosleep): Make this work on Solaris.
	From Brandon S. Allbery.

1998-10-17  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esddsp.c: added Yosh's slick trick for transparently
	rerouting /dev/dsp to esd.  Only tested with Linux and
	x11amp.  Directions are in the source file for the brave.

Sat Oct 17 02:20:42 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.c, acconfig.h, configure.in: emulated nanosleep with select
	for systems that don't have it. Compiles on DU4, FreeBSD

	* audio_oss.c: FreeBSD uses __FreeBSD__, not FREEBSD

1998-10-16  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* filter.c, mix.c, players.c: misc optimizations courtesy of Bibek.

	* audio_hpux.c: HP-UX patches courtest of Jimmy Olsen <jo@hrp.no>.
	It is claimed that esd now runs on HP-Ux

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, filter.c, players.c, proto.c: added support 
	for multiple simultaneous monitor streams.

Fri Oct 16 02:48:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.h: removed system includes so it doesn't "pollute"

	* audio.c, esd-server.h, esd.h, essrldcat.c esdctl.c, esdfilt.c,
	esdloop.c, esdmon.c, esdplay.c, esdrec.c, esdsample.c: added
	in specifc #includes so it compiles again

1998-10-14  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* Makefile.am: esdctl now uses getopt_long, and therefore needs
	the LIBOBJS in it's LDADD.

	* esdctl.c: beefed up esdctl for industrial grade use.  added an
 	exit_usage function, and getopt style option parsing.  It was
 	destined to become esdsh, but this in combination with a real
 	scripting language should be suffient.

1998-10-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c, proto.c: trap for NULL name sent to sample_getid(),
 	and check for sample names beyond the head of the list.

Mon Oct 12 23:12:03 CDT 1998 Frank Belew <frb@umr.edu>

	* esd.h: removed anything resembling a socket header
	* esd-server.h: added everything removed from esd.h
	* audio_alsa.c: #include esd.h instead of esd-server.h since sockets 
	are not needed.
	* esdlib.c: removed superfluous headers that are already included from
	esd-server.h

1998-10-10  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, esd.h, esdlib.c, mix.c, proto.c, filter.c,
 	esdfilt.c Makefile.am, .cvsignore: filter patch courtesy of Bibek
 	Sahu. ten points to the first person to create esdequalizer. does
 	libgsl do digital filters?

Tue Oct  6 20:57:37 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.c: nanosleep in the no data ready case too, so we don't
	suck up CPU

Sat Oct  3 13:31:29 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* audio.c: added driver_trace variable for sound driver debug
	messages

	* audio_alsa.c: use driver_trace instead of esdbg_trace, since
	that's limited to the server. Fix Pav's completely broken fix.

Thu Oct  1 19:27:22 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.m4: make it work right

1998-10-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esound.spec[.in]: make autoconf do the version updating for us.

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: move version updating to same place.

1998-10-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_alsa.c: multiple audio card detection patches from Bibek.
  	This should open and use the first available card under ALSA.  It
 	has been tested on single card systems, and works fine.  However,
 	no one with multiple audio cards has tested this, so if anyone is
 	feeling brave and adventurous... =)

1998-10-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.h, esdlib.c: why sample size is treated as a long in esdlib,
 	but an int everywhere else is beyond me.  64 bit platforms should
 	be happier now. still have to check 32-64 bit interoperability

	* configure.in: touch-ups and commenting *shudder*.

Thu Oct  1 22:58:03 CEST 1998 Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>

	* esdlib.c: added kludge to esd_sample_cache() to make it
	work under Alpha. Problem was to send a long and receive an int.
	On Alpha this makes extra 4 bytes of crap enough to bring
	client and server out of sync. Probably a better solution is
	to change the prototype for size from long to int.

1998-10-01  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (esd-config): Turn on execute bit only if
	`esd-config' was generated.
	(getopt_long): New check.
	* getopt.h, getopt.c, getopt1.c: New files.
	* Makefile.am (esdplay_LDADD): Add LIBOBJS.
	
Wed Sep 30 21:08:19 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esd.m4
	* esd-config
	* configure.in: Added support for esd-config (like GTK+). Added
	explict disabling of local sound (for an audio data server). Fixed
	NEW_ALSA detection. Define HAVE_INET_ATON if we have it.

	* audio.c
	* audio_none.c: support for no local sound

	* esdlib.c: provide inet_aton implementation if it's not avaliable

1998-09-29  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.c: updated obsolete info. As noted by Sopwith,
 	termination procedure, clean_exit(), needed tweaking.

	* esd.h, esdlib.c, esdsample.c, proto.c: esd_sample_getid(),
	for fetching a sample id from the name, courtesy of Sopwith.

	* esdcat.c: FILE *source = source; /* hello, mcfly? anybody 
	in there? */ pointed out by Bibek, Sopwith, and others...

1998-09-27  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in: `AC_PROG_RANLIB' is rendered obsolete by `AM_PROG_LIBTOOL'

	* esdlib.c: added the missing esd_close() function.  no need for 
	clients to know they're dealing with a socket.

1998-09-25  Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* autogen.sh: added libtoolize --copy --force to autogen.sh per
	Andreas Jellinghaus <aj@dungeon.inka.de>

1998-09-26  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c: artistic changes 

	* configure.in: add check for nanosleep, Solaris needs -lposix4.
 	Also included potentially useful information for obtaining the
 	audiofile library.

	* esd.c: forced a wait in esd.c while in standby mode, so there's
	still some CPU to go around.

	* esound.spec: version number update, maybe make a esound.spec.in?

Wed Sep 23 13:05:11 CDT 1998  mej <mej@mw.3com.com>

	* clients.c, configure.in - Fixes needed to find FIONBIO macro,
	  at least on Solaris
	
1998-09-23  Kimball Thurston <kimball@sgrail.com>

	* clients.c - Make sure that the socket when connected is marked
	  as non-blocking

	* audio_irix.c - Fix to reset the output rate every time a sample
	  is played, so other utilities that play sounds and rudely
	  change the output rate on SGI systems can't mess with esd too
	  much

1998-09-22  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* AUTHORS, TODO: updates/formatting

	* acconfig.h, audio.c, audio_alsa.c, configure.in: "New" ALSA
 	driver detection courtesy of Bibek Sahu.

1998-09-20  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* configure.in: made esdplay a --enable-able option, that was fun.
	let's bump up the revision level here, too, while we're at it.

	* esd.c, mix.c, samples.c: i think i've got the 8bit stuff working,
	but it needs to be cleaned up, and preferably use function pointers 
	over if-else blocks to pick the appropriate 8bit/16bit algorithms.

1998-09-19  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* AUTHORS: decided to add my own name to the file, so people can
 	blame me a little more directly
	* Makefile.am: added optional building of esdplay.  
	* configure.in: added optional building of esdplay based on
 	whether or not -laudiofile is found.  made several "artistic"
 	changes to configure.in.  also added feedback about the expected
 	failure of the various audio header and lib tests.  hopefully
 	people won't think their system is horribly broken if not all of
 	the tests pass.
	* esdplay.c: added Simon Kagedal's auto format sniffing player for
 	esd, requires the audiofile library, which is in gnome cvs)

	* audio.c, esd.c, esd.h, esdcat.c, esdloop.c, esdmon.c, esdrec.c,
	esdsample.c, mix.c, players.c: allow different server rates, too.

	* esd-server.h, esd.c, mix.c, players.c: started the 8 bit server 
	overhaul.  many off by *2,/2 errors remain.  still straightening out 
	buf_size_samples vs. buf_size_octets issues... 16bit seems to work.

1998-09-05  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.c, mix.c, esd-server.h: fixed the annoying buzz while monitoring

1998-08-28  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_alsa.c: Nick Lopez - added the missing audio_alsa.c

1998-08-09  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_irix.c: Kimball Thurston - corrections for irix.

	* audio_hpux.c: Dave Glowacki - corrections for hpux and {esdcat,rec,mon}

	* Makefile.am, acconfig.h, audio.c, configure.in: Nick Lopez - added
	support for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture. It seems to work 
	just fine on my SB16 with ALSA driver 0.1.4 and lib 0.0.9.
	still needs audio_alsa.c.
	
	* AUTHORS: updated list of contributors

	* Makefile.am, acconfig.h, audio.c, configure.in, esd-server.h:
	Jeff Dubrule - updated for MkLinux (still need to merge in mix.c)

1998-08-08  Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* fixed Makefile.am to use libtool's versioning correctly :)

1998-08-07  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c: switched to memcpy instead of bcopy.
	* audio_solaris.c: added a few more recognized devices.
		thx to Tynian and Peter Asobeck for Solaris devices.
	* audio_oss.c: powerpc patches courtesy of mackman.
	* esdcat.c: forgot to check the FILE* returned from open, thx vendu.
	
1998-07-16  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, proto.c, samples.c:
	everything but recording works for irix. irix->linux connectivity
	and back works ok, except for remote recording.  keeping track
	of client states seems to be uglier than it needs to be. not so
	mental note to look into that. 

1998-07-15  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, proto.c, samples.c, test-script:
	almost got it all on irix.  still need to tweak sample caching 
	problems. other than that. tried to filter out the esdctl calls
	from test-script, as it doesn't work properly with an ESPEAKER set.

	* esd-server.h, players.c, proto.c: finally got the client state
	code to track endian status correctly, on linux and irix.  gross
	macros to track communication protocol level data. need to filter
	those out via cmd line macro at some point...

1998-07-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.h, players.c, proto.c:
	crack one at including communication level diagnostic info.

1998-07-11  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.c, mix.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c:
	tried to enforce some semblance of order on the trace/debug messages.
	added globals esdbg_trace, and esdbg_comms, for debug msg filtering.

1998-07-07  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c (esd_open_sound): *always* consider an "else" clause
	for every "if"...	

1998-07-05  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdsample.c, esdlib.c: added a confirmation step to the
	sample_cache mechanism.  esd_confirm_sample_cache(esd)
	should return the same sample id as the sample just cached.
	esdlib failed to read this indication back from the server.

	* esd-server.h, esdlib.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c:
	more endian swapping fixes. works for Linux, half of it
	works irix->linux, much seems to be broken on irix. added
	test-script for quick run through of features.

1998-07-04  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.h, esdlib.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c,
	woo! the endian swapping detection is in place, and works, at
	least for byte streams.  still need translation functions in
	the mix logic, to byte swap data buffers before addition.

1998-07-04  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, proto.c: following the lead of 
	the need_validation flag, it's possible that the same problem
	could occur while caching a sample, changed need_validation to
 	client->state, so it can track incomplete protocol requests.
	Still need to add the intelligence for the sample caching.

	* esdlib.c: esdlib now does proper arg checking (NULL for names)

	* esdcat.c: reverted to previous form, name is file (or nothing)

1998-07-03  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esdcat.c: pass a valid pointer for name in esd_play_stream_callback
	(quick fix; esdlib should really do proper arg checking)

1998-07-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_irix.c, configure.in: fixed audio_irix driver. works on an
	Octane.  Autoconf tools are a little weird on irix.  had to manually
	tweak the generated makefile to remove .deps references. added
	lib check routines to find -laudio. look into improving autoconf-irix

1998-06-28  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* clients.c (wait_for_clients_and_data): Return 0.
	(get_new_clients): Remove validation code.  Moved to
	`poll_client_requests' (in proto.c).	
	* proto.c: (esd_proto_lock): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_unlock): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_standby): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_resume): Likewise.
	(poll_client_requests): Centralize validation.  Move invocation of
	`esd_proto_{lock,unlock,standby,resume}' ...
	(do_validated_action): ... here.

	* esd-server.h (struct esd_client): New flag `need_validation'.

	* esdlib.c (esd_lock): Send `ESD_PROTO_LOCK' message, not
	`ESD_PROTO_UNLOCK'. 

1998-06-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* mix.c: removed core-dump causing optimization, thx to keebler.

1998-06-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* players.c: one-liner uninitialized data fix for the occasional
 	random sample killing itself.  Thanks to Chutt for the fix.

1998-06-10  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* samples.c, players.c, clients.c: fixed the perpetual looping
	sample problem.  incremented version to 0.2.2 for possible release.

1998-06-06  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* samples.c, players.c, clients.c: rigged up the sample freeing
	routines to check reference counts before deleting the samples.

1998-06-06  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.h, esd-server.h: moved some server stuff to esd-server.h.
	also added placeholders for an ADPCM mode, and endian issues.

	* samples.c: tuned the check for sample_id in stop_sample()

	* players.c: set up free_sample as the central player "destructor"

	* mix.c: added integral ratio of sample rates optimization.

1998-06-05  Myth  <frb@umr.edu>

	* esd.h: removed reference to config.h.

	* audio.c: added reference to config.h.

	* Makefile.in,aclocal.m4,config.h.in,configure,COPYING,INSTALL,
	config.guess,config.sub,install-sh,ltconfig,ltmain.sh,missing,
	mkinstalldirs: removed from cvs tree, since they are added by
	aclocal/auto*.

	* autogen.sh,HACKING: readme and script for generating files listed
	above.

1998-05-27  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Nearly working on Solaris.
	* audio_solaris.c (esd_audio_open): Clean up.  Make clear that
	this file only knows about CS4231 devices.

	* configure.in: Add checks for connect, gethostbyname and
	inet_aton. 

	* audio.c, audio_*.c: Arch dependent files define
	ARCH_esd_audio_foo if they contain the function `esd_audio_foo'.
	Otherwise, `audio.c' provides a generic function `esd_audio_foo'.
	(Tested only for solaris.) 

	* Makefile.am: Remove building of library without `libtool'.

1998-05-24  Yo 'Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd.c, esdlib.c: 
	added ability to free and reclaim /dev/dsp for use by other
	programs, without invalidating any sample references within
	the daemon.  sound output is consumed by daemon, and ignored
 	until the daemon is resumed.  created esd_lock() and esd_unlock() 
	functions, to hide the transfer of the auth. key from clients.

	* esdlock.c, esdunlock.c:
	removed from source. functionality superceded by esdctl, called
 	with options to	lock, unlock, standby, and resume the daemon.

1998-05-20  Isaac Richards <ijr@po.cwru.edu>

	* audio.c, audio_*.c, configure.in, Makefile.am, acconfig.h, esd.h:
	Added horribly broken(?) drivers for other OSs... These need fixed

	* esdlib.c: Need space for the \0 =)
	
1998-05-19  Yo 'Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esdsample.c: corrected a problem playing samples
	without a simultaneous stream which was instigated by the "better"
	blocking algorithm.  Added simple multiple trigger capability to
	esdsample.c program.


1998-05-16  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* esdlib.c (esd_send_auth): POSIX allows some systems not to
	define NAME_MAX.
