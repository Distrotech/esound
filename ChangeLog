1998-08-08  Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>
	* fixed Makefile.am to use libtool's versioning correctly :)

1998-08-07  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c: switched to memcpy instead of bcopy.
	* audio_solaris.c: added a few more recognized devices.
		thx to Tynian and Peter Asobeck for Solaris devices.
	* audio_oss.c: powerpc patches courtesy of mackman.
	* esdcat.c: forgot to check the FILE* returned from open, thx vendu.
	
1998-07-16  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, proto.c, samples.c:
	everything but recording works for irix. irix->linux connectivity
	and back works ok, except for remote recording.  keeping track
	of client states seems to be uglier than it needs to be. not so
	mental note to look into that. 

1998-07-15  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, proto.c, samples.c, test-script:
	almost got it all on irix.  still need to tweak sample caching 
	problems. other than that. tried to filter out the esdctl calls
	from test-script, as it doesn't work properly with an ESPEAKER set.

	* esd-server.h, players.c, proto.c: finally got the client state
	code to track endian status correctly, on linux and irix.  gross
	macros to track communication protocol level data. need to filter
	those out via cmd line macro at some point...

1998-07-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.h, players.c, proto.c:
	crack one at including communication level diagnostic info.

1998-07-11  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, esd.c, mix.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c:
	tried to enforce some semblance of order on the trace/debug messages.
	added globals esdbg_trace, and esdbg_comms, for debug msg filtering.

1998-07-07  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdlib.c (esd_open_sound): *always* consider an "else" clause
	for every "if"...	

1998-07-05  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esdsample.c, esdlib.c: added a confirmation step to the
	sample_cache mechanism.  esd_confirm_sample_cache(esd)
	should return the same sample id as the sample just cached.
	esdlib failed to read this indication back from the server.

	* esd-server.h, esdlib.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c:
	more endian swapping fixes. works for Linux, half of it
	works irix->linux, much seems to be broken on irix. added
	test-script for quick run through of features.

1998-07-04  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd-server.h, esd.h, esdlib.c, players.c, proto.c, samples.c,
	woo! the endian swapping detection is in place, and works, at
	least for byte streams.  still need translation functions in
	the mix logic, to byte swap data buffers before addition.

1998-07-04  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd-server.h, proto.c: following the lead of 
	the need_validation flag, it's possible that the same problem
	could occur while caching a sample, changed need_validation to
 	client->state, so it can track incomplete protocol requests.
	Still need to add the intelligence for the sample caching.

	* esdlib.c: esdlib now does proper arg checking (NULL for names)

	* esdcat.c: reverted to previous form, name is file (or nothing)

1998-07-03  Manish Singh  <yosh@gimp.org>

	* esdcat.c: pass a valid pointer for name in esd_play_stream_callback
	(quick fix; esdlib should really do proper arg checking)

1998-07-01  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* audio_irix.c, configure.in: fixed audio_irix driver. works on an
	Octane.  Autoconf tools are a little weird on irix.  had to manually
	tweak the generated makefile to remove .deps references. added
	lib check routines to find -laudio. look into improving autoconf-irix

1998-06-28  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* clients.c (wait_for_clients_and_data): Return 0.
	(get_new_clients): Remove validation code.  Moved to
	`poll_client_requests' (in proto.c).	
	* proto.c: (esd_proto_lock): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_unlock): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_standby): Likewise.
	(esd_proto_resume): Likewise.
	(poll_client_requests): Centralize validation.  Move invocation of
	`esd_proto_{lock,unlock,standby,resume}' ...
	(do_validated_action): ... here.

	* esd-server.h (struct esd_client): New flag `need_validation'.

	* esdlib.c (esd_lock): Send `ESD_PROTO_LOCK' message, not
	`ESD_PROTO_UNLOCK'. 

1998-06-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* mix.c: removed core-dump causing optimization, thx to keebler.

1998-06-13  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* players.c: one-liner uninitialized data fix for the occasional
 	random sample killing itself.  Thanks to Chutt for the fix.

1998-06-10  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* samples.c, players.c, clients.c: fixed the perpetual looping
	sample problem.  incremented version to 0.2.2 for possible release.

1998-06-06  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* samples.c, players.c, clients.c: rigged up the sample freeing
	routines to check reference counts before deleting the samples.

1998-06-06  Yo Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* esd.h, esd-server.h: moved some server stuff to esd-server.h.
	also added placeholders for an ADPCM mode, and endian issues.

	* samples.c: tuned the check for sample_id in stop_sample()

	* players.c: set up free_sample as the central player "destructor"

	* mix.c: added integral ratio of sample rates optimization.

1998-06-05  Myth  <frb@umr.edu>

	* esd.h: removed reference to config.h.

	* audio.c: added reference to config.h.

	* Makefile.in,aclocal.m4,config.h.in,configure,COPYING,INSTALL,
	config.guess,config.sub,install-sh,ltconfig,ltmain.sh,missing,
	mkinstalldirs: removed from cvs tree, since they are added by
	aclocal/auto*.

	* autogen.sh,HACKING: readme and script for generating files listed
	above.

1998-05-27  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	Nearly working on Solaris.
	* audio_solaris.c (esd_audio_open): Clean up.  Make clear that
	this file only knows about CS4231 devices.

	* configure.in: Add checks for connect, gethostbyname and
	inet_aton. 

	* audio.c, audio_*.c: Arch dependent files define
	ARCH_esd_audio_foo if they contain the function `esd_audio_foo'.
	Otherwise, `audio.c' provides a generic function `esd_audio_foo'.
	(Tested only for solaris.) 

	* Makefile.am: Remove building of library without `libtool'.

1998-05-24  Yo 'Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esd.c, esdlib.c: 
	added ability to free and reclaim /dev/dsp for use by other
	programs, without invalidating any sample references within
	the daemon.  sound output is consumed by daemon, and ignored
 	until the daemon is resumed.  created esd_lock() and esd_unlock() 
	functions, to hide the transfer of the auth. key from clients.

	* esdlock.c, esdunlock.c:
	removed from source. functionality superceded by esdctl, called
 	with options to	lock, unlock, standby, and resume the daemon.

1998-05-20  Isaac Richards <ijr@po.cwru.edu>

	* audio.c, audio_*.c, configure.in, Makefile.am, acconfig.h, esd.h:
	Added horribly broken(?) drivers for other OSs... These need fixed

	* esdlib.c: Need space for the \0 =)
	
1998-05-19  Yo 'Ric Dude  <ericmit@ix.netcom.com>

	* clients.c, esdsample.c: corrected a problem playing samples
	without a simultaneous stream which was instigated by the "better"
	blocking algorithm.  Added simple multiple trigger capability to
	esdsample.c program.


1998-05-16  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* esdlib.c (esd_send_auth): POSIX allows some systems not to
	define NAME_MAX.
