Playing back "other" sound formats:
-----------------------------------

The sound utility, sox, can be used with esd in primarily two ways.
Method 1:  use sox to convert the file format ahead of time.
Method 2:  use sox to generate output on stdout, and pipe into esdcat

For accurate playback using either method, be sure to match the 
audio format (size/signedness of data, number of channels, and 
sample rate) between sox and esd.  Converting mono to stereo, or
changing the sampling rate with sox is probably not necessary for
live playback, as it will have little effect on sound quality, 
and merely chew up additional CPU.  For example to play back a sample
that was recorded in Sun audio format (.au), mono, at 8000 Hz, using
esdcat, type the following:

sox sample.au -c 1 -r 8000 -t ub - | esdcat -b -m -r 8000

sox arguments: 	-t ub	= data type unsigned byte
		-c 1 	= mono
		-r 8000 = sample rate 8000 Hz
		-	= output file

esdcat arguments: -b	= data type unsigned byte
		-m	= mono
		-r 8000	= sample rate 8000 Hz

Currently, esd only supports unsigned byte, and signed word data types.


Checking recording capabilities:
--------------------------------

To make sure the recoding works, try this WITHOUT esd running:

dd bs=8k count=4 </dev/audio >sample.au


Cthugha - An Oscilloscope on Acid
---------------------------------

esd
xcthugha --listen
esdmon > /tmp/cthugha.com

xcthugha may complain about:
Can't open `/dev/dsp' for writing. (16 - Device or resource busy)
No problem, keep on truckin'. esd gets the sound device, and 
cthugha gets the data it needs.
