If you want to hack on the esound project, it will make you life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU autoconf 2.12
	- GNU automake 1.3
	        (Beta releases are at ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey)
	- GNU libtool 1.2d

These should be available by ftp from ftp.gnu.org or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Beta software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing esound via CVS, then you will need to take several
steps to get it to compile.  You can do all these steps at once
by running:

        cvsroot/esound# ./autogen.sh
   
Basically this does the following for you:

  	cvsroot/esound+# aclocal; autoheader; automake --add-missing; autoconf

        The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
	can run the configure script in cvsroot/esound to create all
	the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool 
in your path.  

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.

If at all possible, please use CVS to get the latest development version of
esound.  You can do the following to get esound+ from cvs:

   $ export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.gimp.org:/debian/home/gnomecvs'
   $ cvs login
     (there is no password, just hit return)
   $ cvs -z9 checkout esound
