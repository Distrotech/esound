Program History:

    This was based on a prototype sound daemon created by Carsten 
    Haitzler (aka The Rasterman).  Some snips of his code are 
    probably still lurking about, but the overwhelming majority 
    of it was written from scratch.

Additional Credits:

    Emusic, to EsounD.  Emusic is a highly customizable sound player
