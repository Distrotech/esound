{"name":"Esound","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/archive/esound","body":"\r\nEsound is an audio mixing server that allows multiple\r\napplications to output sound to the same audio device.\r\nDevelopment on Esound stopped several years ago, in the\r\nhope that someone would write a replacement.  Esound is\r\nseriously lacking in features required for a modern\r\ndesktop environment, particularly for multi-channel\r\naudio and audio/video synchronization.  However, it is\r\npart of the GNOME platform (for a little while longer),\r\nso we slavishly continue to maintain it.  Please don't\r\nlaugh at us.\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported at http://bugzilla.gnome.org.\r\nIt's unlikely that they'll be fixed unless they're\r\nregressions from recent versions or accompanied by\r\npatches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  --ds\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
